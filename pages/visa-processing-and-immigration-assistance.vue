      <h2 class="text-4xl mb-4">Health insurance</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">When traveling to Azerbaijan, it is crucial to have comprehensive health insurance that covers any medical expenses incurred while abroad. Healthcare facilities in Azerbaijan may vary in quality, and private hospitals can be expensive, especially for foreign nationals. Having reliable health insurance is essential in case of an emergency to avoid being burdened with significant medical bills or denied treatment due to insufficient funds.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Furthermore, the risk of illness or accidents while traveling is always present, and being prepared with a valid health insurance policy ensures access to adequate medical care. Traveling without health insurance is not worth the risk, as it can result in unforeseen financial difficulties during an already stressful situation.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">In Azerbaijan, severe medical conditions may require medical evacuation to neighboring countries, which can be extremely costly. With reliable health insurance in place, visitors can be confident that they can receive the necessary medical treatment without significant financial strain. Thus, the peace of mind provided by comprehensive health insurance during your travels to Azerbaijan is essential for a pleasant and safe trip, allowing you to enjoy your vacation and avoid disruptions caused by unexpected medical expenses.

      <h2 class="text-4xl mb-4">Currency</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Azerbaijan’s currency is the Azerbaijani Manat (AZN). It is relatively easy to exchange foreign currency at banks, exchange bureaus, and authorized Forex dealers in tourist areas, major towns, and cities. The Azerbaijani Manat is the accepted currency throughout the country.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">US Dollars and Euros are widely accepted in Azerbaijan, especially by larger hotels, tour operators, and upscale establishments. However, it is advisable to carry smaller denomination notes as larger bills may not always be accepted, or you may receive a lower exchange rate for them.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">If you prefer to use your credit card while traveling in Azerbaijan, it’s best to carry one that has a Visa or Mastercard logo, as these are widely accepted in hotels, restaurants, and larger businesses. However, it is important to note that smaller establishments and businesses in rural areas may not accept credit cards. It is always a good idea to carry some cash as a backup, especially in remote areas where card payments may not be feasible.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">It is recommended to carry both local currency and some US Dollars or Euros in cash when traveling to Azerbaijan. You can exchange your foreign currency for Azerbaijani Manat at banks and Forex bureaus or withdraw money from ATMs. Remember to inform your bank of your travel plans in advance to ensure uninterrupted access to your funds while abroad.

      <h2 class="text-4xl mb-4">Culture and Etiquette</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Azerbaijan is a culturally rich and diverse country with a variety of ethnic groups, and it is important to respect local customs and traditions while visiting. Azerbaijanis are generally friendly and welcoming people who appreciate visitors showing an interest in their culture. When interacting with locals, it is customary to greet them with a handshake and use appropriate titles such as Mr., Mrs., or Doctor when addressing someone.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Modest clothing is generally expected, especially when visiting religious sites or more conservative rural areas. It is advisable for women to dress modestly and avoid wearing revealing clothing to show respect for local customs and to avoid unwanted attention. Public displays of affection should be kept to a minimum, as they are generally frowned upon in Azerbaijani society.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">When visiting someone’s home or a local community, it is customary to remove your shoes before entering as a sign of respect. It is also common to be offered food and drink during visits, and it is polite to accept these offers to show appreciation for local hospitality.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">During meals, it is customary to wait for the host to begin eating before you start. It is also polite to eat with your right hand, as the left hand is considered unclean in Azerbaijani culture.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">By demonstrating respect for local customs and practicing basic cultural etiquette, visitors can enhance their experience in Azerbaijan and foster positive interactions with the local population. Embracing and understanding the cultural diversity of the country will enrich your journey and create meaningful connections with the people you encounter.
